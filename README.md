# Telecoms
Group Telecoms Project
By Tomas Barry, Rob Brady and Calvin Nolan.

This project is to recreate Volunteer Computing and Data Mining on a smaller scale to real life examples. 
A report has been included in the root explaining in detail the techniques and ideas we used throughout
the project.

To run the program as intended, run one server and as many clients as you wish, the more clients you have the faster it will find the name hardcoded into line 13 of Server.
